# 1. First, we ask the user to input a list of names, separated by commas.
# 2. Next, we split the string into a list of strings.
# 3. Then, we find the length of the list.
# 4. Finally, we generate a random number between 0 and the length of the list.
# 5. We use that random number to select a name from the list.
# 6. We print out the name that was selected.
